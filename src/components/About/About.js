              Our story started in 2017 as CamScott.me, when Founder, President & CEO, Cameron Scott, was a freelance developer. As a child he gravitated towards technology, starting his career as an IT Technician in 2012, later on he founded a new passion for web design & development, and the history books were sealed. Omniral is a hybrid worker-owned cooperative that will care about its employees as much as it cares about its clients. He teamed up with Chief Technical Officer, Zac Jones and in 2022 the company officially became Omniral Media LLC, more commonly known simply as omniral.
